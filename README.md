## *Purpose*

This project was created to explore Makefiles in a deeper manner, by using some
of the functionality of make to enhance code maintainability. This means 
creating variables to define paths to source and header files, using variables
to change the configuration of the compiler, and using automatic variables to
ease the commands make must execute.

In this manner, the Makefile is not necessarily easier to read, at least during
the initial glance. It may take a few viewings of the Makefile, as well as a 
few viewings of a manual page to piece together all this information. Luckily,
we live in the age of the internet, so all this information is at a click of a
button.
